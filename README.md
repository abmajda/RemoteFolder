# RemoteFolder
This was the end of semester project for introduction to networking. I decided to code the project in JAVA using swing for the GUI as I had no experience with either and wanted a project to practice them with. The assignment was to create a client and server program that can run on command line to allow remote access to a folder and provide upload/download capabilities. The folder in question is the RemoteFolder which must be placed in C://. In order to get extra credit I modified the program to allow for multiple users to access simultaneously with access controled by semaphores. Basic authentication is provided by the Accounts.txt which contains username/password pairs seperated by commas. While I am aware that it is poor practice to use it that way that was all that was required by the extra credit. Subfolders were also taken into account and folder creation and navigation was implemented. A GUI was also created using swing. It is honestly quite ugly but it was my first ever GUI and I learned quite a bit from my mistakes.
